# Example Judge Panel Configuration for Rubric Kit
# ===================================================
# This file demonstrates how to configure a multi-judge panel for more
# reliable and robust evaluation results.
#
# Environment Variables:
# You can reference environment variables using ${VAR_NAME} syntax.
# You can also provide defaults: ${VAR_NAME:-default_value}

judge_panel:
  # List of judges (LLM models) that will evaluate each criterion
  # Each judge evaluates independently, then results are combined via consensus
  judges:
    - name: Qwen3:8b
      model: qwen3:8b
      # API key can be null to use OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, or none to use ollama
      api_key: none
      # Base URL can be null to use default OpenAI endpoint
      base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1

    - name: gemini-2.5-pro
      model: gemini-2.5-pro
      # Use environment variable syntax: ${ENV_VAR_NAME}
      # Or with default value: ${ENV_VAR_NAME:-default_value}
      api_key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}
      base_url: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/

  # Execution configuration: How judges are called
  execution:
    # Mode options:
    # - "sequential": Call judges one by one (safest for rate limits, default)
    # - "parallel": Call all judges simultaneously (fastest, may hit rate limits)
    # - "batched": Call judges in batches (balanced approach)
    mode: batched
    
    # Batch size (only used when mode is "batched")
    # Determines how many judges are called simultaneously in each batch
    batch_size: 3
    
    # Timeout in seconds for each individual judge call
    # If a judge takes longer than this, it will be considered failed
    timeout: 240
  
  # Consensus configuration: How judge votes are combined
  consensus:
    # Mode options:
    # - "quorum": Specific number of judges must agree (threshold required)
    # - "majority": More than 50% must agree (threshold auto-calculated)
    # - "unanimous": All judges must agree (threshold = number of judges)
    mode: quorum
    
    # Threshold: Minimum number of judges that must agree on the same result
    # Required for "quorum" mode, auto-calculated for "majority" and "unanimous"
    # In this example with 3 judges and threshold 2: at least 2 must agree
    threshold: 2
    
    # What to do when consensus is not reached:
    # - "fail": Use conservative approach (minimum score or fail) - DEFAULT
    # - "median": Use median of all judge scores (for score-based criteria)
    # - "most_common": Use most frequent result (ties broken conservatively)
    on_no_consensus: fail
